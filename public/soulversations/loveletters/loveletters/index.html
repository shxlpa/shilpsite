    <p>I spent my summer springing between work in Torrance and the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Engineering as an artist is tricky; it feels unemotional and inhuman. Trapped in numbers and performance reviews, you start to wonder where we went wrong as a species.</p>
<p>The mountains were my respite this summer. They provoked curiosity and art out of me each time I went. It was like filling up at a gas station at the start of each week.</p>

<p>Echo Lake, Tahoe</p>
<h4 id="a-lyric-by-searows-">A lyric by Searows-</h4>
<p><em>Funny how it disappears the second you get in</em></p>
<p><em>When the world comes to terms with the way that it spins</em></p>
<p><em>Funny how you rearrange, how your mind begins to change</em></p>
<p><em>Hold yourself a little tighter</em></p>
<p><em>In the arms of your old age</em></p>

<p>I like thinking about the categories that humans cannot touch. We may only know about the surface of these hills; granite hills streaked with gray sediment, plunging into frigid lakes and desert. We do not have permission to know about the caves and rock inside these hills - not until nature decides to show us. All of this is more permanent than I.</p>
<p>But still, actually possibly even because of this, I grave the sweetness of my partner. There are big, huge things in this world. Mountains, trees with wisdom, avalanches. It all just reminds me how small I am.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never felt big out here. That&rsquo;s the point. To be the younger sibling of creation and to learn my place. But smallness - that&rsquo;s a feeling that I&rsquo;m tying for the first time to another human being. I see pairs everywhere now. In two squirrels chasing each other and screaming down a tree. In a pair of butterflies fluttering across the trail. A school of fish nibbling at my feet in a secret pool on the edge of echo lake.</p>
<p>At 7:17 pm at Pear Lake in Sequoia, the fish start to come to the surface. They tell you they&rsquo;re there by leaving rings on the surface. Some choose to launch themselves out of the water, and I don&rsquo;t have service nor proficient knowledge of ecology, so this behavior is funnier than it is sensible. Maybe there&rsquo;s reason to it, or a scientific answer, but I don&rsquo;t want to know. The little guys jump, and at this, I laugh.</p>
<h2 id="72024">7.20.24</h2>
<p>Paige, do you remember how my takeaway from Big McGee lake was the richness of information in the world? The fact that you could look anywhere out here and you&rsquo;d notice a million things about the form and function of the universe.</p>
<p>Do you remember our countless silly forms of studying positions? I want things to study again, at the same time that you have to study, so we can make up excuses to be near each other despite our workload.
There is so much information, rich &amp; imbued into this relationship. What do we even talk about? It feels like absolutely nothing and everything, all at once.</p>
