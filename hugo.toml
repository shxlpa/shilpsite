I'm SHILPA, a musician and electrical engineer. I study at UCLA and I have upcoming jobs in electric boats and space manufacturing. 
I released my debut album, ESSAR, in Dec 2023 - stay tuned for my first ever music video coming out this summer.

This is a space for me to keep my network updated on my projects. 

I'll post every [sometimes](https://waitbutwhy.com/), and I promise not to spam you - I just hope this is a cool way to keep everyone updated with my life.

What to expect: I *create* in areas spanning music production, the internet of things, microcontrollers, web development, woodworking, DIY musical instruments, arranging/composing musical pieces, and general full-stack code development + hardware.
